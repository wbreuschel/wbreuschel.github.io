Sound Machine is a tool for narrative emersion through sound. Possible use cases include:

* Story telling, perhaps through: 
    * podcasting,
    * roleplaying (e.g. DnD),
    * stage performance,
    * or simply reading a book before bedtime.
* Personal focus or relaxation
    * while studying or working,
    * or to help fall asleep.

Users of Sound Machine can set a scene for listeners

### Purpose

Sound Machine is basically a soundboard, but it there a few features planned that may set it apart. Sound Machine's prime directive is to be available anywhere and be completely customizable. Soundboard software has been around for a long time, and there's probably not a lot of innovation that is possible on the concept, however, I've not seen a great browser-based solution.

### Features

1. Browser-based, cross platform. (Possibly an Electron app and/or NativeScript app to facilitate better interfacing with sound hardware and offline use)
2. User configurable through JSON. Sound Machine will be completely client-side and won't host assets. Users bring their own.
3. Scripts allow for rich customization and reuse of sounds.
